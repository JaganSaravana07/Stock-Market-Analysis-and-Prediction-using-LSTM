# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM - Stocks[Tesla, Netflix, Meta, Nvidia]

## Description

The financial markets are characterized by their inherent volatility and unpredictability, making accurate predictions a challenging task. In recent years, advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promise in forecasting stock prices. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock market trends using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data. The project leverages historical stock data to build a predictive model, aiming to assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model using LSTM networks to forecast stock prices accurately. By answering the following key questions, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and actionable insights into stock market movements:

1. **What was the change in price of the stock over time?**

   Analyze the historical price movements of stocks to understand the trends and fluctuations over a specified period.

2. **What was the daily return of the stock on average?**

   Calculate the average daily return of stocks to assess the performance and volatility of individual stocks.

3. **What was the moving average of the various stocks?**

   Compute the moving averages of different stocks to identify the overall direction of the market and smooth out short-term fluctuations.

4. **What was the correlation between different stocks?**

   Determine the correlation between various stocks to understand how the prices of different stocks move in relation to each other, which can aid in portfolio diversification.

5. **How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?**

   Assess the value at risk (VaR) to estimate the potential loss in value of an investment over a specified period under normal market conditions.

6. **How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?**

   Utilize LSTM networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, providing a predictive model that investors can use to make more informed investment decisions.

This project aims to bridge the gap between complex deep learning models and practical financial applications, offering a reliable tool for investors to enhance their decision-making process.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and machine learning utilities.
- Keras (or TensorFlow): For building and training the LSTM models.
- Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and testing.
- YFinance (or Pandas Datareader): For fetching stock market data.

## Conclusion
The project on stock market analysis and prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks successfully demonstrated the application of deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices. By leveraging historical data, the model was able to provide valuable insights and predictions for stocks like Tesla, Netflix, and Meta.

### Key findings from the project include:

### 1. Model Accuracy and Performance:
- The LSTM model showed a high level of accuracy in predicting stock prices, as evidenced by the close alignment between the predicted values and actual closing prices.
- The model's predictions consistently followed the trend of the actual stock prices, with minimal deviation, indicating robust performance.

### 2. Evaluation Metrics:

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which confirmed its effectiveness compared to other traditional models like ARIMA and linear regression.

### 3. Predicted Values:

The final predicted results, demonstrate the model's capability to forecast future stock prices accurately. For example, on 2024-07-26, the actual closing price was 219.800003, while the predicted value was 250.347290, showing the model's predictive power over a range of dates.

### 4. Practical Implications:

The LSTM model's predictions can serve as a reliable tool for investors, aiding in making informed investment decisions. The ability to predict stock prices accurately can help in strategizing entry and exit points in the market, thus optimizing investment returns.

In conclusion, the project highlights the potential of LSTM networks in financial forecasting. The model's accuracy and consistency in predicting stock prices make it a valuable asset for investors looking to leverage machine learning for market analysis. The project successfully bridges the gap between complex deep learning models and practical financial applications, providing a reliable framework for stock price prediction.
